Understanding the common terms used by the Steem blockchain is an important part of being able to build applications and tools that use it. This section outlines several of the common terms.

**Account**: An account is a container for all of the activity associated with a particular user's wallet on the blockchain. This includes all of their tokens, posts, comments, upvotes, transfers, etc.

**Block**: Every three seconds, the Steem blockchain produces a new block. Each time a new block is produced, the distributed network is updated with all of the transactions that occured within that block.

**Comment**: A comment is text content that is stored on the blockchain. Comments can be linked to other comments as "replies" through parent/child relationships.

**Key**: Keys are used to authenticate transactions. Each key contains a public/private pair. When a transaction is submitted to the Steem blockchain, it is signed by the account owner using their private key. The blockchain is able to determine that the transaction is valid by validating the signiture against the public key from the pair. 

**Node**: A node is an instance of the Steem blockchain running on a server.

**Post**: A post is a root level comment - one that has no "parent".

**Rewards Pool**: Every day, a fixed amount of STEEM tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.

**Tag**: A tag is a descriptor that is used to identify the type of content contained within a comment/post.

**Transaction**: A transaction is a submitted update to the Steem blockchain. This can include token transfers, posts/comments, votes, etc.

**Vote**: A vote is an expression of like (upvote) or dislike (downvote) for a post/comment. The Steem blockchain uses the votes that a post/comment has received to determine it's share of the rewards.

**Witness**: A witness is responsibile for signing and validating blocks for the Steem blockchain.
